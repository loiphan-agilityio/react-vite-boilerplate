 * Handler for Vite's `vite:preloadError`: after a deploy, a tab still open on the previous release
 * asks for lazy chunks that are gone (netlify.toml answers 404), so the route cannot load. Reload
 * once to get the new index.html. A second failure within `windowMs` is left to the route's error
 * page, so a chunk that is really missing does not reload in a loop.
