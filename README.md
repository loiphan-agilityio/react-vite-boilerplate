## 🌐 Live demos

Everything below is built and deployed to Cloudflare Pages by [CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml) on each
push to `main`.

| | What | Link | Source |
|:-:|---|---|---|
| 🚀 | **Web app** | [react-vite-boilerplate-9od.pages.dev](https://react-vite-boilerplate-9od.pages.dev) | `apps/web`, built on the MSW mocks (`pnpm build:mock`): it has no backend yet |
| 📚 | **Storybook** | [react-vite-boilerplate-storybook.pages.dev](https://react-vite-boilerplate-storybook.pages.dev) | Every component state, with the a11y addon |
| 🧪 | **E2E report** (Allure 3) | [react-vite-boilerplate-allure.pages.dev](https://react-vite-boilerplate-allure.pages.dev) | Playwright run against the production URL above |
| 📊 | **Unit coverage** (Vitest) | [react-vite-boilerplate-test-converage.pages.dev](https://react-vite-boilerplate-test-converage.pages.dev) | HTML coverage report of `pnpm test` |

> [!TIP]
> The latest `main` before the production deploy is also served on the `main-draft` branch alias,
> and each pull request gets its own `pr-<number>` preview (both send `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`).

## 🧰 What is inside

| | Area | What you get |
|:-:|---|---|
| ⚛️ | **App** | React 19, Vite 8, TypeScript 6 (strict), React Router 8 (lazy route objects, a route error boundary), a stale-chunk reload after a deploy. No SSR. |
| 🎨 | **UI** | shadcn/ui on Tailwind CSS 4 (CSS-first theme tokens), shared as the source-only package `@repo/ui`; lucide icons, sonner toasts, a dark theme. |
| 🔌 | **Data** | Effect 4 (typed HTTP client `ApiClient`, config and errors), TanStack Query 5 (server state), React Hook Form 7 with Effect Schema validation. Every request goes through `ApiClient`; lint rejects `fetch` and `axios`. |
| 🎭 | **API mocks** | MSW 3, one set of handlers for the dev server, the tests and the stories, so the app runs with no backend. |
| ✅ | **Quality** | Vitest 5 and Testing Library (coverage gate: 80% of lines in `src/features` and `src/lib`), Playwright with axe accessibility checks, Allure 3 reports, Storybook 10, Lighthouse. |
| 🛠️ | **Tooling** | Oxlint (type-aware, plus the vendored anti-slop rules, no ESLint), Prettier, Husky, lint-staged, commitlint, Dependabot. |

## ⚡ Quick start

Needs Node 22.22 or newer and pnpm 11 (the version is pinned in `packageManager`;
`corepack enable` picks it up).

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev:mock   # the API is answered by MSW mocks: no backend needed
pnpm dev        # needs a real backend at VITE_API_URL (copy apps/web/.env.example to apps/web/.env.local)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `VITE_API_URL` is the backend's base URL and `VITE_API_MOCKING=true` turns the mocks on (`pnpm dev:mock` sets it from `apps/web/.env.mock`). Every `VITE_*` value is public: it ends up in the bundle, so never put a secret there.

## 💻 Commands

Run them from the root; turbo runs each in every package that has the script.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm lint` / `pnpm lint:fix` | 🧹 Oxlint (type-aware, `--deny-warnings`) and Prettier, check or fix |
| `pnpm typecheck` | 🔎 Type-check every package |
| `pnpm test` | 🧪 Vitest with coverage; `pnpm test:watch` re-runs the tests a saved file affects |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | 🎬 Playwright on the mocked build; `pnpm test:e2e:install` downloads Chromium once |
| `pnpm build` | 📦 Production build |
| `pnpm --filter web storybook` | 📚 Storybook on port 6006; `pnpm build-storybook` builds it statically |
| `pnpm lighthouse <url>` | 🔦 Lighthouse (mobile) on a deployed or previewed page |
| `pnpm check` | 🛡️ Every gate: the six below |
| `pnpm check:report` | 📋 The same gates, going on after a failure, then a checklist with pass rates and coverage |
| `pnpm test:tools` | 🔧 The tests of the scripts in `tools/` |

One package: `pnpm --filter <name> <script>`.

## ✅ Check

`pnpm check` runs six gates, and you run it before committing:

| # | Gate | Tool |
|:-:|---|---|
| 1 | Lint and format | Oxlint, Prettier |
| 2 | Type-check | `tsc -b` |
| 3 | Unit and component tests | Vitest, Testing Library, MSW |
| 4 | Production build | Vite |
| 5 | Storybook build | Storybook (fails when a story does not compile) |
| 6 | End-to-end tests | Playwright, axe |

`pnpm check:report` runs the same gates and prints a checklist with the unit and e2e pass rates
and coverage (`pnpm test:e2e:install` downloads Chromium once per machine). `pnpm lighthouse <url>`
scores a deployed or previewed page (CI does it on every preview deploy). While coding,
`pnpm test:watch` re-runs the affected tests on every save.

## 📁 Project structure

```
apps/web/                     the app (package `web`): src/app, src/features, src/lib,
                              e2e/ (Playwright), .storybook/, public/_headers (Pages headers)
packages/ui/                  @repo/ui: shadcn components, cn(), Tailwind theme tokens
packages/typescript-config/   shared tsconfig bases
tools/                        check:report and Lighthouse scripts, the vendored anti-slop rules
.github/workflows/            ci.yml: the whole CI/CD pipeline
.husky/                       git hooks
oxlint.config.ts              the one linter's rules
```

Inside the app, code is organized by feature (`src/features/<name>`), each component with its own
tests and stories. Apps depend on packages, never the reverse, and packages are source-only and
consumed through their `exports` (`@repo/ui/components/button`). The full layout, the code style
lint enforces and the testing rules are in [apps/web/CLAUDE.md](apps/web/CLAUDE.md).

## 🚢 CI/CD

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pull requests and on pushes to `main`:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["🧹 Checks<br/>lint · types · unit · build"] --> B["🔍 Deploy preview"]
  B --> C["🔦 Lighthouse"]
  C --> D["🚀 Deploy production<br/>main only"]
  D --> E["🎬 E2E on production<br/>main only"]
```

1. **Checks:** lint, typecheck, unit tests with coverage, the app build, the Storybook build and the
   build that gets deployed.
2. **Deploy: preview:** the app and Storybook go to Cloudflare Pages (`pr-<number>` on a pull
   request, `main-draft` on `main`).
3. **Lighthouse:** on the preview; accessibility must be 100 and SEO at least 95, performance and
   best practices only warn.
4. **Deploy: production** (`main` only): the same files go live, once Lighthouse passed.
5. **E2E: production** (`main` only): the Playwright tests run against the live URL and publish the
   Allure report. It gates nothing, since it runs after the release.

Setup (Pages projects, the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` secret and the variables) and the branch
protection ruleset are described in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md),
with what to change before real users (a backend instead of the mocks, among others).

## 🔀 Git workflow

- 📝 Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) (`feat(scope):
  summary`); the `commit-msg` hook rejects anything else.
- 🪝 `pre-commit` runs Oxlint and Prettier on the staged files, then `pnpm typecheck`. Fix what it
  reports; do not commit with `--no-verify`.
- 🚧 `pre-push` refuses `main`, `master`, `dev`, `develop`, `stag`, `staging`, `prod` and
  `production`: those change through a reviewed pull request.

## 🏗️ Create a project from this template

`create/` is a CLI that makes a new project from this repo: a web app (with or without
authentication) or a landing page.

```
pnpm create react-vite-turbo my-app                  # asks what to build
pnpm create react-vite-turbo my-app --app --auth     # web app with sign-in
pnpm create react-vite-turbo my-site --landing       # landing page, no API layer
```

See [create/README.md](create/README.md) for the options and how the templates work.
